The steps you took to create and manage branches.
How you handled the merge conflict.
How the pull request process helped you ensure code quality and collaboration.

I can't remember what my original conflict was, and I didn't realize this was apart of the assignment process. Sorry.
There was a lot of confusion trying to get the pull request to work, and I had 3 different classmates trying to help me figure out why I couldn't do a pull request.
And then I had to ask Quinn what I was doing and it seems like I had accidently made a second repository in my main repository. So, a different kind of conflict.
And then I had to make a change to be able to have a pull request my classmates could respont do.
However, after submitting on Canvas, I couldn't find where all my classmates requests were.
So far, I have found the pull request to be complicated and overwhelming. 

Did receive help and figured out how to find peer work to comment on. 
Still feel mildly overwhelmed by the process
